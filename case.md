# Case

Beginner cases:

1. [Nifty Case](https://www.cre8audio.com/niftycase) 
1. [Intellijel Palette] (https://intellijel.com/shop/cases/4u/4u-palette-eurorack-case/?attribute_colour=Silver&attribute_width=62hp)
1. [Pod 64x] (https://4mscompany.com/p.php?p=979&c=9)
1. [Caixa 104] (https://nano-modules.com/caixa-104/)
1. [RackBrute 3U] (https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/rackbrute-3u/overview)

Are the main three I think to consider. I think the [TipTop Mantis] (https://tiptopaudio.com/mantis/) is too big, I need to
have something that'll fit on my desk with the keyboard also. The RackBrute seems nice and sits higher than the desk, but I
think may take up too much space on the desk.

Intellijel Palette looks nice, but it's small (62), but has the extra row. The Pod 64x is too minimal I think and the Caixa is
too pricey. I think the Nifty Case is the ideal solution here. There's a bundle option that comes with cables and a couple of
modules. I think this, and the incoming Music Thing, will be a good starting point, and I can hook up the keyboard using
the MIDI to CV interface.
